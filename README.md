# crowndb-public

## For now this repository is here just to house the wiki for our central database "crowndb".  Our data is stored in PostGres and is accessible to authorized users. The powerpoint slides that create the graphics are in the main repository. Each section of the data handbook is stored as a separate md file in the wiki repository.  To clone the wiki locally, clone https://github.com/precision-sustainable-ag/crowndb-public.wiki.git
